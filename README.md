## Server Side Code
Server side code is written in Node.js using Loopback.

## Client Side Code and Interfaces
Client Side code is written using Angular6, and is then ported over to a wordpress app

In order to build the latest client side code and add it to the wordpress app

```
# May have to run:
# npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
# npm audit fix
source chemgen_docker_vars.sh
cd chemgen-next-client
npm install
ng build --prod  --output-hashing none --output-path ../chemgen-next-wptheme/js/ng
```

## Bringing up the docker sev servers

Included is a set of docker compose configurations to bring up all services using docker.
There is no data persistance and this is meant for DEV USE ONLY.

Running  `./run_chemgen_server.sh` will bring up the docker compose instance.

The dev servers do not have any experimental data, only the configurations. In order to load experimental data you will need to process 1 or more screens. take a look at the jobs/processQueues.js script to see some options for searching for workflow configurations.

```
source chemgen_docker_vars.sh
cd chemgen-next-server
## See the one time setup to install pm2
pm2 start server/server.js --name chemgen-next-server --watch -i 1
pm2 start jobs/defineQueues.js --name chemgen-next-define-queues --watch -i 1
node jobs/processScreens.js --limit 2 --site AD --search-pattern CHEM
node jobs/processScreens.js --limit 2 --site AD --search-pattern AHR 
#ctrl+c to escape either of these
```

You should some info messages print to the screen: 

```
info: Starting workflowQueue Wed Oct 03 2018 09:28:49 GMT+0300 (+03)
info: ExpScreenUploadWorkflow.doWork CHEM Primary 6 2014-12-04
```

If you don't see these messages your queue is probably stuck, or something went wrong with the docker startup.

```
pm2 restart chemgen-next-define-queues
pm2 logs chemgen-next-define-queues
```

Check the server and the job queue logs with -  

```
pm2 logs chemgen-next-server
pm2 logs chemgen-next-define-queues
```


If you want to ensure you have a clean startup 

```
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm -f -v
./run_chemgen_server.sh
```

If for some reason you want to empty the wordpress database and startup info:

```
docker volume rm chemgen-next-web-docker_wordpress_db_data
```

### Important Environmental Variables

Make sure to set the site as appropriate, NY, AD, or DEV. The default is dev.

### Important API EndPoints

#### Get Exp Sets (Regardless of scored/not status)

(For now you can only search for RNAis. Chemicals are coming soon!)

```
http://localhost:3000/api/ExpSets/getExpSets?search={"pageSize": 20, "rnaisList": ["vab-10"]}
```

#### Unscored ExpSets

This is the most optimized query - if you are not searching across the entire database for a gene or chemical list use this
```
http://localhost:3000/api/ExpSets/getUnscoredExpSetsByPlate?search={"pageSize" : 1 }
```

This is another endpoint that is less optimized, but allows for search across the entire database for rnais/chemicals 
```
http://localhost:3000/api/ExpSets/getUnscoredExpSets?search={"pageSize" : 1 }
```

### Get Exp Sets that have a FIRST_PASS=1 Score
```
http://localhost:3000/api/ExpSets/getUnScoredExpSetsByFirstPass?search={"pageSize": 20, "scoresExist": true}
```

### One time startup instructions

#### Bring up the node server

I am having trouble getting these working as docker containers, so for now you have to do it the hard way. First ensure you have node.js>=9.

```
npm install -g pm2 @angular/cli nodemon karma mocha
```

To start the loopback server

```
cd chemgen-next-server
## Run in the foreground
# if Error: Cannot find module 'loopback'
# `run npm install` in this directory
nodemon server/server.js
## Run in the background
pm2 start server/server.js --name chemgen-next-server --watch -i 1
```

To start the angular dev server

```
cd chemgen-next-client
npm install
# bind wasn't found
# ng serve --host=0.0.0.0 instead
ng serve --bind 0.0.0.0
```

#### Wordpress

If it is your first time running this you will need to visit localhost:8000 in order to do the initial wordpress install (for now).

Once it is installed you will also need to create a page for the angular app to live on.

In the wordpress console go to 'Create New Page', and create a page called 'App' with the permalink 'app' and from the Template 'ChemGenAngularApp' 

### Analysis Modules

#### Tensorflow Counts

The docker configuration in chemgen-next-analysis-docker requires some data files that are too big for github and will need to be hosted somewhere. You can get the most recent version on the cloud with `        docker pull quay.io/nyuad_cgsb/tf_14_faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_tf_counts:latest`

#### Devstar Counts

The configuration is all here, but since devstar is a private github repo you will need to go and download the repo as a zip and put it in the chemgen-next-analysis-docker/counts/devstar folder.
